Helpful Tips:

You can have it mild or super-spicy, depending on your taste. Use hot chili beans, tomatoes with chilies or any spicy version of the above. I use all mild, as I am not a fan of spicy food. You can also a lower-fat variety by choosing the fat-free refried beans, the low-fat Velveeta, and ground turkey.
